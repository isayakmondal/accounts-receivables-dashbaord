# HighRadius Internship

**This Project is done for HighRadius(HRC) as a part of Winter Internship Program 2022.**

In this internship the time frame has been divided into two phases where:
## Phase 1: (Project)
In the first phase I built a machine learning model that automates `account receivables` given a dataset/data(supervised machine learning). We have to understand the data, preprocess the data, execute feature engineering and finally train a model to predict `account receivables`.

## Phase 2: (Milestone I and II)
In this phase I built a full stack `Invoice Management Application` using `ReactJs, JDBC, Java, JSP and SQL` which include:
- Visualize Data in the form of grids.
- Performing `CRUD` operations on each data.
- Performing searching operations on the invoices.
