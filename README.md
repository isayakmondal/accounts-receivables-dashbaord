# Accounts Receivalbes Dashboard

**This Project is done as a part of my Winter Internship Program 2022.**

In the initial phase of the project, I developed a machine learning model to automate the process of managing account receivables. This involved analyzing and understanding the dataset, preprocessing the data, performing feature engineering, and training a supervised machine learning model to predict account receivables.

In the subsequent phases, I completed Milestone I and Milestone II by building a comprehensive Invoice Management Application. This application was developed using various technologies such as ReactJs, JDBC, Java, JSP, and SQL. The application provides features such as visualizing data in grid format, performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on invoices, and enabling searching operations on the invoices.
